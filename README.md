# performance-matters-server-side

A server-side application. The app is changed to its bare minimum. You can only show a list of all Parks. The full version you can view here:  [Parks of Amsterdam](https://velomovies.github.io/Project-1-WEBDEV/app/#home). 
I removed all javascript in this version and tried to enhence it.
